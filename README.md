Jumbo Pixel Display
-------------------

This is a set of tools to make a giant LED display with jumbo-sized pixels.

Each pixels are approximately 33.3mm square. They're designed to appear right
next to each other without a visible seam when they're on (though you can see
the baffle)

Ingredients
-----------

* many spools of 30-LED-per-meter APA102-C LED strips
* many large sheets of opaque white 1.58mm polystyrene (this is what you make
  the baffle out of)
* 1 large sheet of transparent acrylic to match the size of the display you
  want to make (for the front)
* a large sheet of vellum to project the LEDs onto
* 1 large sheet of opaque acrylic (or anything, really) to act as a back to
  hold all the LED strips in place
* a large power supply to power the whole display. I'm using Mean Well
  RSP-500-5
* A bunch of cables to inject power periodically into the display. The APA102
  strips I got have 2.1mm/5.5mm barrel jacks for power input, so I ordered a
  bunch of those from Digikey
* Something to drive the display with. They take SPI, so anything that speaks
  that should be great. (A Raspberry Pi is what I'm using)
